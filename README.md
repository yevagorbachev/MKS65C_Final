## How to play
  0. Clone the project and download the required libraries.
  1. Type make in the terminal.
  2. **To play locally:**  
      *Terminal 1*
      ```
      $ ./server  
      ```
      *Terminal 2*
      ```
      $ ./client
      ```
         
      **To play over a network:**  
      *Terminal 1*
      ```
      $ ./server <IP Address>
      ```
      *Terminal 2*
      ```
      $ ./client <IP Address>
      ```
  3. Take turns moving your pieces.
      ```
      pawn = p
      rook = r
      knight = n
      bishop = b
      queen = q
      king = k
      ```
      Proper notation for a move is the letter of the piece followed by the starting square, then the destination square.  
      *Example: pe2e4 moves your pawn on e2 to e4*
   4. The game ends when your king is in checkmate. Have fun!
